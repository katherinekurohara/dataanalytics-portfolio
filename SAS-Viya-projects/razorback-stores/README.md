Goal: Use SAS VIYA to analyze Razorback Stores' marketing campaign data, including data partitions, crosstabulation, descriptive statistics, visualization, linear regression models, and correlation matrices.

Background: Razorback Stores is a local department store serving a metropolitan area. As a department store, they offer a wide variety of items and services and track sales through a point of sale system. Over the past several months, Razorback Stores performed a marketing campaign designed to promote and incentivize a loyalty program. After evaluating several market leaders in analytics software, Razorback has decided to go with a cloud version of SAS VIYA.
