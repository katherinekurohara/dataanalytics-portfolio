## Analysis of NBA game and player data

### Data:

* 2021-22 NBA Player / Game Log Data - .csv file containing raw data for each player from each game
* NBA Player Salary Data - web-scraped data containing player names and their respective salaries and projected salaries for different seasons

### Background:

There are 1230 total games played in a regular NBA season with about 450 players. Due to injuries and replacements, typically over 500 players will play in at least one game of the regular season. The 2021-2022 regular season ended in April, and I am now able to work with a full set of game logs tracking each player's performance across every game, and data containing players and their respective salaries for the 2021-22 season.



### Purpose and Key Questions:

To collect, clean, model, and visualize NBA data in Google Colab using Python, using modules pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. I analyze the correlation between performance and salary, defining predictors and visualizing connections between data points. 

* Who are the top scorers in the 2021-22 season?
* Who are the most cost-effective scorers?
* Who are the highest paid players on a specific team? Who are the most cost-effective players on that same team?
